% Array Questions

1. write a function which rotate an integer array by given amount.
As demenstrated:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> rotate by +1 -> [6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> rotate by +3 -> [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> rotate by -2 -> [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]

```java
public class ArrayTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	}
}
```
